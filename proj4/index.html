      <h2 align="middle"> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          In this project, we implemented functions that would allow multiple particles in a system to behave similarly to how they would behave in the real world and simulated a cloth dropping
          on multiple surfaces. In part 1 of this project, we implemented a mass and spring representation of a cloth, taking multiple particles and representing the forces between them as if there was
          a spring, bringing them closer if the particles moved too far apart and repelling them if the particles moved too closely together, preventing the cloth from expanding or contracting excessively.
          In part 2, we implemented functions that would be simulate the behavior of objects in real life, applying forces to point particles when they fall in space and preventing the forces between objects
          from being deformed. In parts 3 and 4, we implemented functions that would simulate how objects interact with other objects (including itself), making sure it would not pass through objects or
          fall into itself. Finally, in part 5, we implemented shaders, which allowed our cloth to be rendered as different surfaces and giving the appearance of texture on the surface.

      The first two images above show the cloth pinned on two corners with default parameters in both the wireframe and the normal shading scheme. The next
      two images show the normal cloth with high and low values of ks. The following images show the wireframe cloth with high and low damping values and the last two show
      the wireframe cloth with high and low density.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third and fourth images, we ran the simulation with a value of k = 500 and a value of k = 50000. For the lower k value, the image appears as if the cloth is not pinned
      tightly, causing a looser resting position for the cloth. In contrast, the higher k value gives a sense that the two corners are pinned very tightly and the resting position looks very
      taut. After the cloth falls, the bottom of the cloth for a low k value ripples a little bit, almost as if it is bouncing back, while the cloth with a high k value moves as if all the particles
      are more tightly connected. This makes sense intuitively as well, as a higher ks value indicates that the force between each object is stronger and the entire cloth will tend to move all together
      while a lower k value indicates the each part of the cloth may move in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next two images show high and low values of damping, which is the amount of energy lost as the cloth moves
      around due to gravity and other physical forces. The first image with low damping was generated when the cloth reached its lowest point and bounced back up. The cloth bounces up quite high since
      there are no forces that reduce its velocity, and all of the energy is kept by the cloth. By the conservation of energy, it should be able to bounce back up to its highest point. Conversely, in the
      image with high damping, the cloth loses much of its energy even before it reaches its restful state the first time. The cloth moves slowly down to its restful state, and when it does, does not bounce back
      up very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final two images show high and low density values. For a low density value, the cloth appears to drop less than the the cloth with a high density value. This is similar to a high k value for a low
      density value and a low k value for a high density value.

  <p>
    In the images above, we have three images of the cloth dropping on a sphere with different values of k, then two images of a cloth dropping on a plane with both
    wireframe and normal shading. For the simulation of the cloth dropping on the sphere, as the value of k increases, there are fewer folds within the cloth and the cloth
    is spread out more. This is consistent with the explanation in part two of the project, where a higher value of k indicates that the forces between the particles between the particles
    are strong. Thus, the cloth tends to behave more similarly across different areas of the cloth, leading to fewer grooves and the cloth not sinking as low as the lower k values.

  <p>
    In the images above, we have screenshots of our cloth falling vertically against a plane and folding against itself. The last three images show the cloth
    in various states of self collision, including the starting state, when it first touches the plane, and after the cloth comes to rest. The first two images show the cloth
    with low and high values of k and the second two images show the cloth with low and high values for density. We first notice that the cloth with a low value for k correlates more
    closely to the cloth with a high value for density and conversely the cloth with a high value for k correlates to a low value for density. Similarly to the cases above, the cloth with
    higher values for k and lower values for density have fewer grooves and appear to behave more similarly to other regions of the cloth. We again believe that this is due to higher magnitudes of
    forces between particles for the cloth. Conversely, the cloth with low values for k and high value for density has many more grooves and takes longer to settle down.

  <p>
    Shader programs are programs that take in an input and outputs a four dimensional vector. This is particuarly useful when rendering simulations or images, since many objects
    are involved with a position vector or a color vector. A vertex shader addresses the first of these vectors, where it will ultimately output a position of a vertex after applying
    geometric transforms to a vertex, such as modifying the positions or considering normals to objects. When the cloth drops onto an object, it is the vertex shader that provides the new position
    that vertex will arrive at. A fragment shader addresses the other vector, where reflections and physical properties of materials are considered to provide a final color or display that the camera
    lens takes in. The output of the vertex shader is the input of the fragment shader.
  </p>
  <p>
    When rendering Blinn-Phong shading, we considered both the diffuse components of specular components of light. More specifically, there are terms where light is not reflected strongly off of the surface and the
    surface appears to be more monotonous. There are also terms for the specular components of light, where we are able to gain a sense of the direction light reflects off the surface. Combining the both of these
    terms, we are able to have an image that is closer to the physical properties of the surface while giving a sense of where light intersects the surface, something we are unable to visualize only with a diffuse
    shader.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the simulation that used the texture mapping, we used texture_4 and for the simulation that used bump and displacement mapping, we used texture_3. In both situations, when we set the flags to be -o 16 -a 16,
    the images appeared darker than having the flags to be higher. Further, our displacement mapping has the grooves more clearly noticeable than the bump mapping.
  </p>

  <h2 align="middle"> Responsibilities for the Project</h2>

    <p>
      In this project, we worked as a team to develop each task. We would often code at the same time, checking with each other for questions that we had, clarifying what certain functions did and the implementation of
      pseudocode in lecture. When we discovered bugs in the project, we would also both attack the bug at the same time, letting each other know tests we were doing, discussing possible issues and dismissing other issues as
      a non-cause for the bug.
