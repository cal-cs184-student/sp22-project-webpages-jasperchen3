    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <div>
    <p>
      We began this project with several control points and parameters and were able to derive a smooth curve, with differentiable first and
      second derivatives using de Casteljau's algorithm. We extended that to Bezier surfaces and were able to model a 3D shape using flat shading
      with similar principles. After that, we worked very closely with the half-edge data structure and other related components to be able to use Phong
      shading, which allowed us to shade the mesh more accurately and as if there was a light source directed toward the object of interest. We then implmented the
      edge-flip and edge-split algorithms, which were ultimately used in the upscaling operation to model a 3D object more finely.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project was particularly interesting as it allowed us to begin to model objects in the 3D world, as well as change the shapes of parts of the object without
      affecting other parts of the object. We can imagine that shifting vertices in some smooth, method way will lead to the modeling done in movies or animations without
      having to rerender the entire mesh. This is in contrast to project 1, where we mostly worked with 2D objects and could not rotate them and see different parts of the object.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            What Casteljau's algorithm does is that it takes a set of n control points and a parameter t and outputs a single point. It takes the n points and linearly interpolates between each adjacent point at the t
            and this in turn results in n - 1 points. We then recursive run Casteljau's algorithm again on these n - 1 points until eventually we're left with only one point. If we repeat this procedure for many values of t from 0 to 1,
            the points outputted will result in a smooth curve which we call the Bezier curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way we implemented the algorithm was that most of the code was already given to us, but the only step we needed to implement was the recursive step. What we did was that we immediately
            returned the vector of points if there was only a single point in the vector since that means we finished and our vector only contains the final interpolated point. Otherwise, what we did was first
            initialize a vector. Then, we'd go through each adjacent point in the given vector of points and then linearly interpolate with the adjacent points and variable t which was provided to us in the form of a member variable in the BezierCurve class.
            We'd call push_back on the result and store it in the initliazed vector. Once we were finished, we just returned the vector interpolated points.

    <p>
      Implementing Bezier surfaces with de Casteljau subdivision was, in essence, similar to part one. A notable difference between them
      was that we were given a nxn grid of points in space, and each row represented a particular Bezier curve. For a particular parameter, u,
      we were able to compute one final point for each of the curves, which in turn represented a curve. Then, as we vary from u to v, we are able to
      generate points for each intemediate parameter and generate a surface as a result. Implementing the Bezier surface was similar to implementing the
      Bezier curve, where we return a vector of points when there is only a single point left, which means that we are finished interpolating the points.
      We repeated that for each row in our original grid, so we were able to retrieve a set of vectors, generating a surface.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
    <div>
      <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="images/3-before.png" align="middle" width="400px" />

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
        <p>When implementing the vertex normals function, we began by accessing a particular face and associated half edge for
          that face. Using that half edge and the next pointers for the half edges, we were able to access all of the vertices
          associated with the face, since we do not store pointers to vertices within the face data structure. We then computed the
          normal vector for that particular face, then iterated through the other half edges extending from the same vertex using the
          twin pointer associated with the half edges. We returned the sum of all the normal vectors for all of the faces of the triangles
          connected to the vertex. </p>
   </div>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
      <div>
        <div align="middle">
          <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
              <td>

              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
          <p>When implementing the edge flip algorithm, we first accessed all data structures present in the original triangle,
             including all of the half edges, edges, faces, and vertices. We do not introduce any new mesh components into our mesh when we apply the
             edge flip operation, so we do not add or delete any elements. Instead, we take the old edge and reassign the half-edge associated with it,
             as well as updating the twins and next half-edges for each respective half-edge. </p>
          <p> When writing this function, the biggest difficulties lied in keeping track of all the necessary pointer updates that we needed
              to change. One example of this would be changing the next half edge that a particular half edge pointed to, but not updating the twin
              so that multiple iterations would lead to errors. We adddressed this issue by inspecting the GUI and comparing the pointers and the components
              that half edges pointed to to an image drawn out and labeled accurately. </p>

      </div>
          <p>
            Implementing the half-edge split algorithm was very similar to part 4 and implementing the half-edge split algorithm. When starting off the
            algorithm, just as in part 4, we accessed all the data structures present in the original triangle, including the half-edges, edges, faces,
            and vertices. However, in contrast to part 4, the half-edge introduces many more data structures, including a new vertex, 4 new edges, 2 new
            faces, and 8 new half edges. After creating the data structures, the algorithm loads our new data structures with pointers and we made edits to
            existing data structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much of the difficulty in implementing this algorithm was similar to part 4, where we lost track of which pointers needed to be updated and often
            led to bugs when chaining together multiple edge splits. The first split would often work, but the data would not be updated correctly and cause
            bugs when calling the edge split algorithm on a different edge. We approached this issue by inspecting the mesh components closest to the edge that
            was split, such as the degree of adjacent vertices and the objects that half edges pointed to. We were able to detect a bug where two pointers were swapped,
            causing one vertex to have degree one larger than it should have and another vertex to have degree one smaller than intended.
          </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
    <div>
          <p>
            When implementing subdivision for mesh upsampling, we first began by computing the new position of existing vertices by considering its old positions and
            the positions of its neighboring vertices. Next, we computed the locations of vertices that would form as a result of edge splitting by considering the
            positions of vertices on and adjacent to the edge. We then split all the edges in our mesh and flipped any edge that connected a vertex that was already
            in the mesh to a new vertex formed by edge splitting. Finally, we updated all positions of our vertices with our computed values.
          </p>

          <figcaption align="middle"> cube.dae with pointer errors </figcaption>
          <p>
            We encountered the most challenges when trying to implement and debug this method. The first problem we encountered was our cube completely being deformed
            and having edges point to nowhere in space. We addressed this issue by returning to task 5 and the edge-split method, as we had not set the flags for isNew to be
            true when creating those edges. Our next issue was that the cube looked correct on the inside, but behaved strangely on the corners, and the issue was caused by
            our calculations being cast to integers instead of floats. After addressing that issue, our mesh appeared closer to the cube, but with a several "dents" in the mesh,
            as shown in the image above. We addressed this issue again by revisiting the edge-split function and fixing issues with pointers, as well as explicitly deleting the
            old edge that was split.

            Sharp corners and edges become smoother and smoother as we apply more upscaling operations. When we calculate new positions of
            vertices in the upscaling operation, we take into account the number of vertices adjacent to it. The more adjacent verticies and the
            more iterations of upscaling we apply to a mesh, sharper corners become closer and closer to the vertices next to it, giving a smoother
            appearance to the mesh. However, the images above seem to show that the cube becomes more and more asymmetric when we apply more upscaling
            operations. Specifically, the bottom corner closest to the front of the screen appears to extend out more than the other corners.

          <p>
            One possibility for why the cube without preprocessing appears to be asymmetric as we apply more upscaling operations is that the edges were not
            oriented uniformly across each face of the cube. For some faces, the edge came from the top left to bottom right, and for others, the edge came from the top
            right to the bottom left. We preprocessed our cube by splitting each edge across every face on the cube, so that each face has two edges in the shape of an 'X'
            across it. When we applied more upscaling operations afterward, the cube appears to be more symmetric and the corners of the cube appear to be smoother than the cube
            that did not have any preprocessing. Furthermore, we can observe that in the middle of each face, there is still a square with two edges in the 'X' shope across it.
